# Luadh's UltimateLightKit

This is a Lightkit meant for the 3D Program [Cinema4D](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/products/cinema-4d/overview/).

Currently it works perfectly from the version R15-R20 (Tested), a version for R14 won't be made.

If you want to see examples of it, you can check the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPms3Kn5CXgcyB-cL_Lx_5w) and look for LCLK in the description.
